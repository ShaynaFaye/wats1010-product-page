Design Concepts

After I watched the video for the API Superstore, I was reminded of Old Spice.  The video was kind of quirky and funny, in how we're selling people a pointless product that doesn't really save them money.  So I used Old Spice commercials as my inspiration (where the guy is talking to the camera, doing random things that are supposed to be manly and cool). The site is meant to be quirky, like it's trying to be cool, manly, and hipster.  On the site I used to find images, I typed in "hipster" and used a few of those photos. It doesn't all make sense, but it's all meant to be part of the silly cool tone. The product itself doesn't make sense, it's useless and we're selling it to users (as the video states) at exorbitant prices.  I had fun designing this site.
